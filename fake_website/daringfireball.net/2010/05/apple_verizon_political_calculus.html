<h1>Apple-Verizon Political Calculus, 2010&#160;Edition</h1>
<h6 class="dateline">Wednesday, 12 May 2010</h6>

<p>Regarding <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/05/11/verizon-android-tablet">Verizon&#8217;s announcement</a> of a supposed forthcoming Android iPad-alike tablet, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/11/verizon-google-tablet/">MG Siegler wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The big question is: will it get ugly enough that Apple will re-up
with AT&amp;T and forget about a Verizon iPhone? Or maybe they have
already, which is why McAdam would make such a pro-Google
statement? The next few weeks leading up to Apple’s WWDC event
in June should be interesting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot to unpack here. First, I&#8217;ll state up front that I know very little, one way or the other, regarding whether the iPhone is coming to Verizon this year.</p>

<p>The very little I know is that Apple has a skunkworks CDMA iPhone project. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s anything new &#8212; I think they&#8217;ve <em>always</em> had a skunkworks CDMA iPhone project, very much like the skunkworks Intel version of Mac OS X they kept alive during the PowerPC era. It&#8217;s just obvious common sense: be prepared.</p>

<p>So, technically, yes, Apple could offer a CDMA iPhone HD (or whatever they&#8217;re going to call the next-generation iPhone &#8212; I&#8217;m truly just guessing that it&#8217;ll be called &#8220;HD&#8221;) this year. If they do &#8212; <em>if</em> &#8212; I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;d be ready alongside the GSM iPhone HD for AT&amp;T this June or July; I&#8217;d guess that it&#8217;d be announced in September at the annual iPod event. (If Apple has a CDMA iPhone HD ready to unveil in June, they&#8217;ve kept it under far, far tighter wraps than any previous new iPhone.)</p>

<p>As for whether Verizon&#8217;s vaporous pre-announcement of an Android tablet might squelch such a deal with Apple, count me in with Dan Frommer &#8212; if anything, Verizon&#8217;s early talk of such a tablet makes more sense as a negotiating tactic regarding the iPhone and iPad. <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/google-tablet-story-just-verizons-ploy-to-get-leverage-over-apple-2010-5">Frommer writes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Think about it. There is ZERO reason for Google and Verizon to
pre-announce a tablet collaboration, likely several months before
anything is available for purchase. There is only downside from
something like that &#8212; delays, other disappointments, etc. (Who&#8217;s
going to make it, anyway? HTC? JooJoo?) Look what happened to
Microsoft when everyone found out its &#8220;Courier&#8221; tablet was just a
design mockup.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there is EVERY reason for Verizon to make it look like
it&#8217;s doing something threatening to Apple.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Strategically, the Apple-Verizon relationship is fascinating.</p>

<p>Verizon wants the iPhone. It&#8217;s a popular and profitable phone; iPhone users pay high monthly service fees. AT&amp;T&#8217;s current iPhone exclusivity is its biggest, maybe even <em>only</em>, advantage against Verizon. AT&amp;T&#8217;s plans aren&#8217;t cheaper, and their service quality is infamously worse. If Verizon had the iPhone, surely many current AT&amp;T customers would switch. And, some number of existing Verizon customers who would have switched to AT&amp;T just to get the iPhone would instead stay with Verizon. Simply put, a Verizon iPhone would be terrible for AT&amp;T. That&#8217;s reason enough for Verizon to want it.</p>

<p>Apple wants Verizon. They have a better network, especially in major markets like New York and San Francisco. Yes, with CDMA, there&#8217;s a technical limitation where you can&#8217;t use 3G data while you&#8217;re on a voice call, and Apple and AT&amp;T have run ads pointing this out. That&#8217;s unfortunate, but I don&#8217;t see it as a big deal. I can&#8217;t recall ever hearing anyone with a Verizon smartphone complaining about this; contrast that with the zillions of complaints from iPhone users about AT&amp;T&#8217;s network quality. More importantly, Verizon has the most customers. The simple truth is that many people, when shopping for a new phone, choose a model from their current service provider. There are some number of people who would buy an iPhone on Verizon who will not ever buy one on AT&amp;T &#8212; and that &#8220;some number&#8221; is, I think, very high. In short, Verizon offers Apple significantly higher U.S. market share.</p>

<p>Really, we&#8217;re right back where we were a year ago with Apple-Verizon rumors. I could pretty much just re-run today <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/05/verizon_iphone_rumors">this piece I wrote a year ago</a>. (I&#8217;d change my prediction that we&#8217;ll see a Verizon iPhone &#8220;before the end of 2010&#8221; to &#8220;before the end of 2011&#8221;, though. But I still think it&#8217;s a question of <em>when</em>, not <em>if</em>, the iPhone will be available through Verizon.)</p>

<p>One difference today from a year ago, though, is that Android has blossomed into a popular platform &#8212; and in the U.S., that&#8217;s largely attributable to Verizon. You can see why Verizon wants Android phones &#8212; and now tablets &#8212; whichever way it goes with Apple. If Verizon is not soon getting the iPhone, they want a good rival. If they are (or even just may be) getting the iPhone, they want to be in the best possible negotiating position.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T is in a weak position &#8212; they <em>need</em> the iPhone to remain theirs exclusively. Verizon and Apple are both in strong positions &#8212; they might <em>want</em> each other, but neither yet <em>needs</em> the other. That&#8217;s what makes this so interesting.</p>

<p>But imagine a hypothetical world where there was no Android, or where Android was utterly unsuccessful in the market. In that world, Apple would be in a much stronger position against Verizon &#8212; in that world, Verizon would <em>need</em> the iPhone.</p>

<p>Lastly, even if Verizon already had the iPhone, they&#8217;d still want a strong Android platform. A strong Apple does Verizon no good, regardless of whether they&#8217;re carrying the iPhone. Verizon&#8217;s interests are best served in a market where there are many phone makers &#8212; Apple, RIM, HTC, Motorola, Samsung, HP &#8212; none of which are in a dominant position.</p>
